# Lysis-Web
An open source web app for Lysis so you can host it yourself if you'd like.

[Demo site](http://headlinedev.xyz/lysis/)

## Dependency
This project requires the [java lysis decompiler](https://github.com/peace-maker/lysis-java) so feel free to compile it yourself or you can just
[download mine](http://www.headlinedev.xyz/lysis/lysis-java.jar) if you're lazy. I'll try to keep my copy up to date. As of this writing, the jar is built from commit `076db68`, if this is outdated, please let me know.

## Installation
- Copy files over to your webserver
- Ensure that the lysis-java.jar is inside of your webserver directory
- Rename htaccess.txt to .htaccess
- Celebrate
